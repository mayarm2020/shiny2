## 2017 Car crash data in Allegheny County

his Application uses data about car's accidents in Allegheny County in the US, To demonstrate various capabilities from the Developing Data Products Course.
The Application provides visualization about car accidents in Allegheny County in 2017.


- Using Shiny UI Server Application. 
- Using Leaflet interactive MAP application. 
- Adding customized markers, and Popup. 
- Two Input Widget (Drop down list and Slide Bar).
- Using Reactive function. 
- Server Business logic (Subsetting data frame based on input).
- Full help page (Documentation).


## The Data

- Data contains information on all accidents in Allegheny County in 2017.
- Data used: Geo Location data. 
- Months of the Accident. 
- AUTOMOBILE_COUNT -  the number of cars involved. 
- FATAL_COUNT - Total number of death. 
- ILLEGAL_DRUG_RELATED - Ilegal drug involvement. 
- DRINKING_DRIVER Number of Drunk People involved in the car accident. 
- INJURY_COUNT - Number of injuries. 
- Fatal And INJURY - Will be used to classifying the type of the accident 
    And create different Icons. 



## Data and Server calculations 

The following calculations are done in the server :

- Load data. 
- Subset data - remove the accidents with zero cars involved. 
- Remove NA items.
- Create new columns which classify the accident (Death/Injury/None).
- Check the Min and Max cars number involved and pass it to the slider input.
- Slice the dataset dynamically based on Month selection and the number of cars selection. 


## Data and Server calculation (Cont.)

```{r, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,comment=NA }

DF<-read.csv("Allegheny.csv") 

#Subset the location of the car crash (Latitude and longtiutiate)
# To show the information on  a Leaflet MAP 

#Subset only the accidents which the at least one car is involved.

#Keep the data about the month of the accident.
#Create a new column with the month's names instead of a number. 
#Since there is a large number of the crash 
#There will be an option to show car crash per specific month
#For information to present in a popup :
#AUTOMOBILE_COUNT -  the number of cars involved 
#FATAL_COUNT - Total number of death 
#ILLEGAL_DRUG_RELATED - Ilegal drug involvement 
#DRINKING_DRIVER Number of Drunk People involved in the car accident 
#INJURY_COUNT - Number of injuries 
#Fatal And INJURY - Will be used to classifying the type of the accident 
#And create different Icons
